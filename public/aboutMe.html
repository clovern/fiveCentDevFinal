            <p>My name is Nicole, and I am a beginning programmer and web developer. I recently moved from Michigan to Colorado, 
                and in my free time I have been exploring new places for hiking and biking in my new state. I also enjoy disc golfing, 
                strategy board games, magic the gathering, and learning new songs on the acoustic guitar.
            </p> 
            <p> I started teaching myself programming in mid-2020, beginning by learning Python. Since then, I have begun pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
                at Colorado State University, and have been teaching myself JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js in my free time. I thought building this website would
                be a fun way to practice Web Development and display some of my projects as my programming skills grow.
