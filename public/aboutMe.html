        <p>My name is Nicole, and I am a beginning programmer and web developer. I started teaching myself 
            programming about a year and a half ago, beginning by learning Python. Since then, I have begun
            to love programming and started to teach myself JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as well. Recently, I
            started the Computer Science program at Grand Valley State University, and I thought this website 
            would be a great way to share some of my projects as my programming skills grow.
