            <p>My name is Nicole, and I am a Computer Science student at Colorado State University. I moved from Michigan to Colorado a few years ago, 
                and in my free time I have been exploring new places for hiking and biking in my new state. I also enjoy disc golfing, 
                strategy board games, pickleball, and learning new songs on the guitar.
            </p> 
            <p> I started teaching myself programming in mid-2020, and discovered that I love the puzzle solving nature of coding. I started officially 
                pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science at Colorado State in 2021, and I just graduated in December 2023. Full stack web development and 
                software testing are my favorite areas to work in currently, but I am excited to explore new skills and interests when I join a software 
                development team soon!
