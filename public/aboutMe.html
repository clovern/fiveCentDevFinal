        <p>My name is Nicole, and I am a beginning programmer and web developer. I started teaching myself 
            programming in mid-2020, beginning by learning Python. Since then, I have begun pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science,
            and have been teaching myself JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as well in my free time. I thought this website 
            would be a great way to share some of my projects as my programming skills grow.
